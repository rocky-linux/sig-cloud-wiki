Currently, the major changes in this kernel are the backporting of several changes from stable/mainline kernel branches relating to GVNic drivers for improved performance on Google Cloud Platform. Note that the Kernel is the same version as in any given Rocky Release, but has patches from kernel.org branches backported and applied on top.</p> <p>A full description of the changes the this Kernel has can be found here.</p> <p>Any and all changes which may benefit ease or performance of usage of Rocky on clouds are welcome to be contributed.
